# JavaScript Capstone Project: FlappyBird

> This project meant to be a platform game, based on the requirements giving to me, and it supposed to be delivered on 5 days as max, there are a lot of platform games out there starting from the famous game of the nighties Super Mario, I decided to build the FlappyBird game because to be honest I was always fascinated by it and in the same time I was frustrated how it was hard so the first thought that come to my mind when I heard building a game I thought of build a new and easier version of the FlappyBird.

Then you should run: `npm install`

And afterwards you supposed to run: `npm run server`, to run the project in your local machine.

Congrats the project is fully working.

### Deployment

For deployment I used GitHub pages, but as you see my project is full of files and the `index.html` file is inside the `build/` folder, so in order to deploy using GitHub pages we need to put the `index.html` file in the root of the repository, in order to do this we will use a simple trick, please follow the commands bellow if you want to deploy on your on repository:

- If you have the `build/ `  folder declared inside the `.gitignore`  file please remove it form there.

- run `npm run build`  to generate the build folder.

- then make sure that git knows about your subtree, using this command:

  ```
  git add build && git commit -m "Initial build subtree commit"
  ```

- after that use subtree push to send it to gh-pages branch in GitHub:

  ```
  git subtree push --prefix build origin gh-pages
  ```

Now you have finish check the link of GitHub pages you will find your project deployed there. you can find the link on the repository settings page.
